# ðŸ’¡ Hi there

I'm Jorge JordÃ£o, a full-stack developer focused on building scalable SaaS applications using modern web and AI technologies. I work with Python (Django, FastAPI) and TypeScript (React, Next.js), and I specialize in AI integrations with LangChain, RAG pipelines, and vector databases like FAISS and Supabase. I prioritize performance and clean, maintainable code in every project I build.

My journey in technology began with academic research in Android development, followed by teaching Python fundamentals as a Teacher Assistant. Currently, I'm working as a Junior Developer at InvestMoney SA, where I focus on building AI-powered websites using modern frameworks and intelligent agents to create scalable, intelligent web applications.
